### 🔍 What is the **LGTM stack**?

Think of **LGTM** as a toolkit that helps you monitor and understand everything happening in your software system — like watching the health of your apps, tracking errors, and figuring out what went wrong when something breaks.

**LGTM stands for:**

* **L**oki – Logs
* **G**rafana – Graphs (Visuals)
* **T**empo – Traces (Performance tracking)
* **M**imir – Metrics (Numbers like CPU usage, traffic, etc.)

---

### 🧱 Each component in simple terms:

---

#### 📄 **Grafana Loki** – *Log Aggregation System*

**What it does:**
Imagine every app on your computer writes what it's doing into a notepad — these are **logs**.
Loki collects all these logs from different apps and systems in one place, so you can search and analyze them easily.

**Layman analogy:**
Like having **one big searchable diary** of everything your apps are doing.

---

#### 📊 **Grafana** – *Data Visualization*

**What it does:**
Grafana takes all your data — logs, metrics, traces — and shows them in nice charts, dashboards, and graphs.

**Layman analogy:**
Like a **weather dashboard** that shows temperature, wind speed, and humidity — but for your servers and apps.

---

#### 🕵️ **Grafana Tempo** – *Distributed Tracing*

**What it does:**
Tempo tracks how a request moves through your system.
Example: A user clicks a button → the request goes through service A → then B → then C → then returns the result. Tempo records that whole journey.

**Layman analogy:**
Like **tracking a food delivery** from order to delivery — so you know where delays happen.

---

#### 📈 **Grafana Mimir** – *Metrics Time Series Database (TSDB)*

**What it does:**
Mimir stores and manages numeric data over time — like CPU usage, memory, number of users, etc.

**Layman analogy:**
Like a **fitness app** recording your heartbeat, steps, and calories every day — but for servers.

---

#### 🛠️ **Grafana Agent** (Deprecated) / **Grafana Alloy** (New) – *Data Collector*

**What it does:**
This tool runs on your systems and **collects data** (logs, metrics, traces) to send to Loki, Tempo, and Mimir.

* **Grafana Agent**: Original version
* **Grafana Alloy**: New and improved version

**Layman analogy:**
Like a **mailman** who collects reports from all your devices and delivers them to the LGTM system.

| Tool            | What it handles | Real-world comparison                      |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Loki**        | Logs            | A diary of everything happening            |
| **Grafana**     | Dashboards      | A control panel to view everything         |
| **Tempo**       | Traces          | Order tracking through different steps     |
| **Mimir**       | Metrics         | Fitness tracker for your servers           |
| **Alloy/Agent** | Data collector  | Mailman gathering all your app/system data |

### ✅ Why use LGTM Stack?

* Easy to **see what’s happening** in your system
* Helps **debug faster** when things go wrong
* **Open-source** and works well with Kubernetes, Docker, etc.
* Scalable for both small and big systems
